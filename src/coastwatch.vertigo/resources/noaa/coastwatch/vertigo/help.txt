1. Introduction

Vertigo Beta is a technology demonstration of the JavaFX client application
platform for desktop, and specifically its ability to perform 3D rendering.
Vertigo is designed to display a selection of earth science datasets provided
by the NOAA CoastWatch program (https://coastwatch.noaa.gov).  Datasets are
accessed in real-time from NOAA data servers.

The Vertigo project has a number of goals:

- To evaluate the JavaFX graphics and object models for inclusion into the
CoastWatch Data Analysis Tool (CDAT), or as an offshoot application with
CDAT-like features.
- To experiment with visualization of remote network datasets with an eye for
future cloud data servers.
- To act as a simple interface for the ERDDAP and THREDDS data services,
allowing for easy dataset discovery, visualization, and possibly download.

2. Usage

Vertigo Beta launches with a default configuration that shows a set of buttons
on the right that select a dataset of interest, and on the left that shift to
an area of interest.  The globe shows the most recent data available for the
dataset.  The mouse or trackpad is used to control the view:

- Scroll up to zoom in, or down to zoom out
- Click and drag on the globe to rotate it
- Double-click the left mouse button to zoom in and rotate to that location
- Double-click the right mouse button to zoom out and rotate to that location

There are also several keyboard shortcuts:

- The arrow keys rotate the globe, SHIFT + arrow key rotates faster
- Press A to zoom in
- Press Z to zoom out

3. Future Releases

Depending on interest and development time available, Vertigo may be expanded
to be a more fully functional data viewer for earth science data.  As it is,
Vertigo uses the Java NetCDF library to access datasets over the network.
Theoretically, any dataset available over an OpenDAP protocol on a THREDDS or
ERDDAP server could be accessed by Vertigo.  Vertigo can also access local
NetCDF datasets.  Some initial improvements could include:

- Display of a color bar legend and cursor position
- Ability to select date / time stamp within the dataset
- Ability for user to specify their own datasets and color mappings
- Saving and loading of configurations as Vertigo "projects"
- Server connection status and error indicators
- Improvements in network access speed
